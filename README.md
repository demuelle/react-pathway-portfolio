# React Pathway Portfolio

![screenshot](screenshot.jpg)

This project is the beginning of a portfolio built with React. It contains the following:

- A brief biography with screenshot
- A Projects page with links to deployed project and code
- A Contact page used to exercise some React functionality; Note that this app does not have a back end, so the contact page serves as only a placeholder for now
- A resume page that shows a list of skills and gives an option to download a current resume

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project has been published to GitHub Pages using the gh-pages npm package.
